Tools and resources for developer advancement

Hi, my name is Kevin Fry, and I am a developer.
I work in a field that's always being developed.
To stay current with everything, I want to teach others to both maintain and increase their skill development.

I know my code isn't always going to be perfect, 'cause three months from now,
I'll have a better understanding of the concept and language.

## [dev-daily-taks-basic-template.md](dev-daily-tasks-basic-template.md)
My template is what you'll download at the start of your workday and replace `template` with the naming convention of your choice, but the preferred format is `YYYY-MM-DD` for organizational purposes.

Then replace each `[ ]` (box) to `[X]` to mark it as complete.
